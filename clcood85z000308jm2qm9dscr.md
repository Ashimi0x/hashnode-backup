# Crowdsource: Ashimi’s Guide To Improving Google’s AI and Gain Incentives.

Today, You are able to search on Google using images instead of words, and Google Translate allows you to converse in multiple languages without learning a single one of them, You can easily sort your Google Photos for anything e.g “Red Dresses” “Elon Musk” and it will show all related results in your library.

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Kudos to the amazing engineers at Google for building these applications. At the core of what they built is a technology that is able of processing input like a human mind would and carry out specific actions like identifying which color is red, Which object is a table, and if a person is wearing a black shirt or probably smiling described as **Artificial Intelligence**.

**Artificial Intelligence** can be explained as computers that are empowered to think and perform actions that are like or even better and/or fast than humans. These computers also go through a learning process that helps them develop this intelligence and they are constantly improving as well by collecting feedback, learning, and adjusting to offer better results called **Machine Learning**

Now that you understand what machine learning or artificial intelligence means, Perhaps, it helps you paint a better picture of how your different apps work but how are Data gathered and used to train these apps?

There are a lot of technical and non-technical ways to do that but In this article, we will focus on a non-technical approach to improving AI or more specifically Google's own AI

## **Google Crowdsource**
