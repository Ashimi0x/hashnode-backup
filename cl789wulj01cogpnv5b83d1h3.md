## Why did I become a Software Developer

"I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious." -Albert Einstein

Curiosity led me everywhere.

I always wanted to make stuff, fix, build or invent something. Growing up, If I wasn't trying to fix a Faulty Electronic, I was trying to build an RC Car/Aeroplane, in another case, studying how some of my electronic toys were built.

Over the years, I have moved from wanting to be a Doctor, Pilot, Story Writer, Mechanical engineer, or Electrical Engineer to becoming a Software Development.

I was exposed to computers very early. Learned Chess with my own laptop at age 7 and had a Symbian Phone by 11. 

## My Discovery
I discovered how to create WAP SITES in 2010 using a sort of CMS called Wapka while downloading games on waptrick and I wrote my first lines of codes using my Nokia Phone. Over time, I will go online and research site designs I could replicate on my wap site, write them on a book, and retype them on my site as Nokia didnâ€™t support Copy and paste.

After my Basic Education, I enrolled to learn Computer Hardware and Bucky Roberts who was the popular Youtube Tutor at the time. I got many of his courses.

I gradually discovered Ethical Hacking, learned about Linux, and read the books of Kevin Mitnick.

Spend most of my time learning about any programming language I found online and studied Ethical Hacking, and experimented with SQL injections and Phishing attacks.

Without Direction, I quickly drifted into Digital Marketing, Blogging, and SEO. Worked as an SEO manager for an Entertainment blog in 2016 and built three unsuccessful blogs in Entertainment, Education, and Tech.

## Tech Community & I

Discovered GDG Lafia in 2018 from their WTM lead, Ruth Samuel and I rediscovered my interest in Development, I attended DevFest that year and started following developer communities very closely, asking questions, seeking guides, and enrolling in programs.

GADS, ALC, and other programs in 2019 gave me the direction I needed. Over time, I was in my little ways teaching others what I knew and giving back to the ecosystem. 

Now, I co-lead OSCA Abuja, FoF Abuja, GDG Gwags, and GDSC IMAP, and I contribute to other communities and others.

I now Code, write content, and organize and speak at events about codes.

Not in my best place yet, I want to transition into a more Technical Writing or Developer Advocacy Role. I also want to be a platform that provides more innovative ways to learn coding and land jobs.  Might take a while but will get there.

Thank you for reading.
