## Web 2 and Web 3.

Hey there, I haven't written here in a long time. Today, I want to write briefly on the differences between Web 2 and Web 3 since I am participating in Block games(an attempt to be a Web3 goD).

For close to 15 years now, The internet has been populated by user-generated content but on Corporate managed platforms, for example, Facebook, Twitter, etc this is an advancement of the old Web 1 where platform and content were managed by the corporate alone.

Web 3 is a further advancement, in this case, Content, Platform, and all that is in between is owned and managed by a decentralized community of individuals or DAO(Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

Users retain ownership and control over their data and their own by the absence of trust issues or need to request permission from an organization. Web 3 will see the proper utilization of AI and machine learning to improve the future of tech and there would be more adoption of Visualization, Graphics, and animation. 

While, We consider the whole a global village because of Zoom, Meet, and all visual conferencing tools and Video calling tools, With the creation of the metaverse, It will become a more connected and localized village. Web 3 will power a lot of paradigm shifts including an advanced monetization of digital media contents, You must have heard of NFTs - Non Fungible Tokens.


There is a lot of impossibilities to expect from the Web 3 Space. WAGMI
