## HacktoberFest 2021 - What you should know.

It is the time of the year for a Fun Celebration of Open Source, Code Contribution, and Developers testing their skills in different projects. Some do it for the fun and love for Code, Others for the T-shirt lol. There were a lot of controversies and arguments around it last year as a lot of Maintainers complained how some made meaningless contributions just to get four PRs and win a Free T-shirt.

The Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration hosted by Digitalocean to appreciate Open Source Creators, Enthusiasts, and Beginners. In the Month of October, You can put out those side projects you need contributors and actually get contributions, You can host events to teach people how to use Git and contribute to open source projects, advocate opensource and You can even decide to donate to the advancement of certain open source project and people could donate to you too(If you ask).

In this year's Hacktoberfest Event, You will be able to use Github as well as Gitlab, and Project Maintainer will be able to receive swags without actually contributing PRs(Certain criteria are involved), and through the Hacktoberfest, Projects will be able to receive direct donations.
