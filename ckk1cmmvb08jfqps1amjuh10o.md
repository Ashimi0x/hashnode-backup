## Certification
Once you have quite an experience in all of the above, you can decide to test your credibility and prepare for employment by getting the certifications, We will discuss below.

- [ eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration
](https://elearnsecurity.com/product/ejpt-certification/) is designed for students with no penetration testing experience, as shown in course content, the instructor’s mode of teaching, and the lab modules. The course teaches about practical skill-sets that are important to penetration testing such as networking knowledge, scripting/programming, vulnerability identification, etc. It has a fairly great structure and is delivered in the easiest way to understand. Although you can proceed to the certification without the course, it is still very recommended you take the course.

-  [Offensive Security Certified Professional](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/OSCP/)  is an ethical hacking certification offered by Offensive Security that teaches penetration testing methodologies and the use of the tools included with the Kali Linux distribution (successor of BackTrack).

-  [Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/)  is a qualification obtained by demonstrating knowledge of assessing the security of computer systems by looking for weaknesses and vulnerabilities in target systems, using the same knowledge and tools as a malicious hacker, but in a lawful and legitimate manner to assess the security posture of a target system.

## Conclusion

Cyber Security is one of the most expensive fields, You are required to do a number of exams and certification. Unlike Software Development, These certifications are very crucial, They are more or less like a "Get out of jail free" Card.

Thanks for coming this far with me, I might be writing soon on preparatory exams for the above certifications
