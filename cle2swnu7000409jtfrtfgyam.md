# This Nigerian FinTech inspires me the most. Here's why.

There are a good number of FinTech companies creating different solutions and they all inspire us in their unique ways.  
Their values and missions often resonate with us as individuals and it usually deepens our appreciation for their innovative products and service, sometimes these organizations are shaping the way we live, work and interact with one another. However, the company that truly stands out and inspires me the most is Cowrywise.

Cowrywise is a Nigerian fintech company that provides a platform for individuals to save and invest their money. Founded by Razaq Ahmed in 2017 after an experience he [shared](https://espact.com/how-rasaq-ahmed-was-inspired-to-start-cowrywise-after-his-near-death-experience/), is considered to be one of the leading fintech companies in Africa with not less than 100,000 users.

What sets Cowrywise apart is its people, healthy culture, and the relationships they build with its users through initiatives like the Student Ambassador Program where they onboard students to preach financial literacy in institutions across Nigeria. Some of the high-performing ambassadors often get the opportunity to intern with the company aside from the other perks attached.

From the CEO to the support staff, everyone at Cowrywise is passionate about their work and dedication to making a positive impact on people's lives.

The HR Manager, [Emmanuel Faith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-faith/) has gained constant recognition due to his commitment to making CowryWise a safe working environment for remote and on-site employees and ensuring the entire experience is enjoyable.

This type of culture cultivates the essence of community and collaboration among employees and serves as a major source of inspiration for Executives and HR experts alike.

Cowrywise takes its mission of empowering people to take control of their financial development very seriously through educative content on its blog and its youtube channel.

Cowrywsie applies different approaches to ensure users see the need to create a better tomorrow and provide them with the tools and resources they need to make informed financial decisions.

Another aspect of Cowrywise that inspires me is how the platform provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for individuals looking to save and invest their money.

There are investment options, starting from low-risk savings accounts to high-risk stock portfolios that give individuals the choice of an investment strategy that aligns with their financial goals.

Cowrywise utilizes an interesting approach to encouraging users to save money. Users can save in groups based on interests like sports, associations they belong to like the Nysc saving plan or their dreams like the Nikkah Saving Plan.

Cowrywise is a company that has frankly inspired me over the years. There have been a lot of testimonials about how Cowrywise is making a positive impact on people's lives and shaping the future of finance.
