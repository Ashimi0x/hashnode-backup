Our lives are constantly redefined by the direction new and emerging technology takes. It is beyond obvious that these are not just tools for developed nations alone.

Technological impacts are predominantly felt in all aspects of the world by every curious being, and as such, they factor into a surreptitious cross-cultural adaptation of globalization.

Globalization used to be driven by economies and politics, but technology now plays an increasingly important role.

New trends, customs, and practices are widely adopted in unimagined ways.

Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and even Twitter are perfect case studies. They connect people irrespective of their society or background, consequently resulting in a cross-cultural exchange of values.

This has led to the emergence of new social norms and behaviors, which have been adapted in different ways depending on the culture.

In some countries, through social media, new fashion trends, dietary habits, or even business models are being adopted from what are considered norms in other parts of the world.

Technology has gradually changed how we exchange finances, and mobile banking has become a popular trend in many developing countries, enabling people to access financial services that were previously out of reach.

The commerce industry has also experienced tremendous growth as a result of the emergence of e-commerce, which enables a near-global scale exchange of products with very minimal or zero limitations in many cases.

E-commerce is the major player in the exchange of styles and trends, particularly in terms of fashion, as Nigerians can simply order Korean apparel online, and that's one of many possible scenarios where cultural exchanges happen.

Cultural adaptions are not seamless, however. There are often a lot of rejections, biases, and conflicts as cultural gatekeepers feel the need to protect the originality of their culture, especially when those changes do not particularly benefit them.

It is often seen as a game of winners and losers, and the culture influencing the change is seen as trying to be superior or making the other feel inferior.

Sometimes, certain cultures are just not comfortable sharing. There have been debates around the use of traditional cultural elements in fashion and art, with some arguing that it amounts to cultural appropriation.

In many other cases, certain cultures hold a moral perspective on certain changes and consider them to have bad and corrupt values.

Often, governments and social leaders may impose restrictions on the technologies that promote these changes in attempts to limit their adoption and adaptation.

Despite such challenges, people are still very curious to discover what other cultures have to offer, and the other cultures are often very determined to spread adoption for different reasons like money or power.

Many a time, these barriers are broken down by the overwhelming power that technology carries. It enables people from different parts of the world to exchange ideas, learn from each other, and create new and innovative solutions to global challenges.

New challenges may even be created, giving room for thinkers and creators to thrive.

The power that technology wields in influencing cross-cultural exchange and adaptation can be tamed to establish new possibilities and foster global development.

The potential benefits are enormous and cannot be overemphasized. But by embracing and adapting to new technologies, we can create a more connected, inclusive, and innovative global community that gives room for individual growth.

Nonetheless, it is also essential that these processes are approached with sensitivity and respect for different cultural practices and traditions. Understanding the complexity of cultural exchange and willingness to engage in dialogue and mutual learning is equally important.

This requires a collaborative effort by governments, businesses, and civil society organizations to promote access to technology and digital literacy for all.
