Laravel is the most popular PHP framework for building web applications. This power technology was created by Taylor Otwell and has greatly impacted how backend applications are being built in the PHP ecosystem.

Laravel is open source and the ecosystem has actively ensured that Laravel stays up to date and there are frequent new releases tackling issues discovered. [Laravel 10 is here.](https://laravel-news.com/laravel-10)

You are probably new to backend engineering, switching from a different technology, have been in the PHP ecosystem, and decided to learn a framework or switch from other PHP frameworks like [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) or [Codeigniter](https://codeigniter.com/). Read along.

Before getting started with Laravel, It is necessary to have a background in PHP. Check out this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK_JCtrrv-c), if you haven't written a line of code in PHP before.

In this article, I will be exploring 23 ways you can begin your journey as a Laravel developer and if you are able to study/practice consistently for at least 3 months, You will experience significant differences. Let's dive in.

### Study Laravel's official documentation

Studying Laravel's official documentation is an essential step in becoming a proficient Laravel developer.

It is a comprehensive guide that covers all the fundamental concepts, features, and functionalities of the Laravel framework.

You will gain a solid understanding of how Laravel works, its architectural principles, and the best practices for building web applications.

It contains clear and concise explanations, and code examples that help you grasp the core concepts of Laravel.

### Learn the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern

Laravel's architectural pattern is based on an approach that separates an application into three interconnected components.  
  
Model: The Model handles data validation, and retrievals, and interacts with the  
database, and is found in your `app\models` folder.  
  
View: The View handles the presentation of data into the frontend interfaces and receives user form inputs and is found in  `resources\views` the folder.

Controllers: The Controller interacts with the model to manage data, and handles the logic that determines what is sent and received from the view and how the entire application operates and is located in `app\Http\Controllers` a folder.

This MVC pattern allows your application easier to manage, test and reuse. It improves the quality of your code and is why Laravel is considered to be flexible. Here is a guide to [understanding MVC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6cPFf0i0Cc).

### Learn the command-line interface (CLI) tool, Artisan

Laravel Artisan is the command-line interface (CLI) tool that comes bundled with the Laravel framework. It provides developers with a wide range of commands to automate various tasks during the development process.

Artisan commands are designed to enhance productivity and streamline common development tasks. Its key advantage of Artisan is the ability to generate code for different components of your application.  
  
For example, you can use the `make:controller` command to create a new controller with predefined methods, or the `make:model` command to generate a new model class.

This saves you valuable time and eliminates the need for manual file creation and boilerplate code writing.

### Get familiar with the Eloquent ORM

Eloquent is Laravel's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) which makes it easy to work with databases.

It allows you to work with database records as objects as opposed to dealing with raw SQL queries. Using Eloquent offers features like a relationship that allows you to define how different tables in your database interact.

With relationships, you can easily retrieve related records from the database, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. Eloquent can help you to manage your data with ease. This playlist gives you a better insight into [Eloquent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCAN-bAFn0).

### Understand the routing system and how to set up custom routes

The Route system is located in `routes` a folder and is an essential part of the framework.

It helps define URLs and handle specific actions like displaying a view or running a method defined in a controller. It utilizes the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

The `web.php` file defines routes that are intended for web-based applications, and the `api.php` file is used for API-based applications useful when building RESTful APIs. Also, you can create an additional route for other [things.](http://things.It)

It also supports middleware which allows you to define how authentication and authorization are done and often you can create a separate `auth.php` file in your `routes` folder. This [Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSYu_XNkJ98) touches more on routes.

### Familiarize yourself with the Blade template engine

Laravel's templating engine makes it easy to write clean and maintainable templates for your dynamic web applications.

The blade syntax is straightforward and easy to learn. It allows you to extend templates and reuse common components in your application without rewriting them, such that your codebase is more maintainable.

Blade engine built-in directives enable you to engage in various operations like conditionals and create custom filters. You can use PHP and HTML codes directly in your templates. This playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1JpS8jP1wgAm1z3ntJZQ0ef9vokjJ56Z) dives into the blade engine.

### Study middleware

Middleware is a feature that gives you control over your application's authentication and authorization flow, They execute before or after an HTTP request is handled by your application and also help with session management, CSRF protection, and more.

Middleware can allow you to modify the request or response objects, and manipulate the data that is being sent or received by your application.  There is a more detailed guide to [Middleware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2N1jAz8nxY).

### Use migrations to manage your [database schema](https://www.ibm.com/topics/database-schema)

Migrations make it easy to manage the database schema. With migration, you can define your database schema using PHP code, version control your database changes, and keep track of changes made to your database over [time.](http://time.It)

It lets you create, modify, and delete database tables and columns and define indexes, foreign keys, and constraints on your tables. Learn the in-depth Migrations [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB2qi8o845k).

### Interacting with your app through the command line using Tinker

It is essentially a REPL (read-eval-print loop) that allows you to run PHP code in the context of your Laravel application.

Tinker allows you easily test out code snippets and experiment while not having to reload the entire application.

You can also query the database and retrieve records, which is important for debugging. When you run the `php artisan tinker` command from the command line, you will have access to the Tinker REPL. To understand Tinker better, Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQyQsP11hjY).

### Dependency injection and service container

The service container allows you to manage and resolve dependencies for your application. It is responsible for creating and managing instances of objects or classes in your application.

Dependency injection is a design pattern enabling you to inject dependencies into an object or class rather than having the object or class create the dependencies itself. They make your code more flexible, easier to test and maintain. Get started [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUz22GUHpNA).

### Form requests and validation

These Laravel features make it easy to validate input data from users. Form requests handle incoming HTTP requests and validate their data. They extend the `Illuminate\Http\Request` class and contain rules that define how to validate the incoming data.

Validation, on the other hand, is the process that ensures that data from input fields are valid and meet the specified criteria.

Form requests and validation helps to prevent errors, improve security and eliminate potential security risks, such as SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and other types of data tampering.

This [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AUV-ZddFhU) helps you understand them better.

### Events and listeners system

An event is a trigger based on an action performed in your application and a listener is a function that runs based on that action and the logic written.

They are used for situations such as sending emails, notifications, database updates, or more. Learn Events and listeners [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vewcmfCnYLY).

### Jobs and queues

Jobs and queues allow you to run tasks that can be time-consuming in the background and not interrupt the main execution flow of your application.

If your web application requires sending bulk emails to users. you can send all the emails at once but this slows the app down. Using a job helps you send each email in the background.

They are added to a queue and processed by a queue worker, running in the background without affecting the performance of your application.

Learn about jobs and queues [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVx8xKisbr8).

### Storage system for file uploads and management

The storage system enables you to upload, store, and manage files. It offers an easy-to-use API making working with files and storage disks simple.

The storage system is flexible and Laravel offers support to local disk, Amazon S3, Rackspace, FTP, and a variety of storage drivers and you can choose the solution that fits your needs.

There are also built-in functions that allow you to read and write files, and create directories. Discover the storage system [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGkMzbAm8mg).

### Built-in authentication and authorization features

Authentication and authorization provide an approach to managing access control in your [application.](http://application.It)

[It](http://application.It) is flexible and extensible allowing you to choose different authentication methods from session-based, token-based, or OAuth. [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9tUWhNmQz4) goes into detail.

### Policies

Policies are a class that enables you to define authorization logic for resources. For example, you create a policy for a blog post that determines who can edit or delete it, It contains rules that define the users that can perform those actions.

Policies often define more complex authorization rules involving more than one resource. They are based on the concept of gatekeepers. Discover [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Fl_Qcfy5o).

### Built-in task scheduler

The built-in task scheduler in Laravel is a feature that lets you plan tasks ahead and have them run automatically at set intervals.

You can set repetitive tasks such as sending emails, database cleanup, and maintenance [tasks.](http://tasks.In)

In using the task scheduler, you define a schedule that a task will run using the fluent syntax or the cron expression and the task that should happen at the end.

Learn about scheduling in Laravel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROW9uiyrolk).

### Built-in email and notification features

Email and notifications are important aspects of your application enabling communication and keeping them informed of useful events or changes that might occur.

These features allow send and receive emails from within your application, or notify your users through channels, like SMS.

These features are not difficult and can be tailored to your needs. Laravel has email templates and allows you to create custom ones too, although, you have to configure your app to use a mail driver such as SMTP, Mailgun, Amazon SES, and more.

Learn how to create templates and configure them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1NPG3nKxrQ).

### Built-in testing features

Testing is necessary to build usable applications and Laravel has built-in testing features that enable automated testing, an example is PHPUnit, the most popular PHP testing framework.

With this framework, you can test your application's logic and functionality, models, controllers, and other components ensuring that functions as intended.

These features ensure that the test cases run automatically and that no existing functionality or changes break and make it easy to catch and fix any bugs or errors. Writing tests helps you confirm your code meets the requirements and you can learn more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsSQy78p0LY).

### Built-in pagination features

With Laravel's pagination features, you divide your data into smaller, less bulky chunks and display them across several pages improving user experience and performance as well as reducing the load on the server.

### Network

Get involved in physical conferences and online communities such as [Laravel.io](http://Laravel.io), Stack Overflow, Laracon, and [EduKarma](http://edukarma.org) so you can network and get help from other developers.

### Build projects

Try creating small to medium size projects based on ideas you have, and ask questions from communities, google, and online forums when you run into issues. Practicing aids retention. Also, participate in open-source. It helps you improve your skills.

### Gain Experience

Gaining real-life experience is a crucial step in your journey to becoming a proficient Laravel developer.

While studying and practicing on your own can provide a solid foundation, participating in a program like EduKarma's or securing an internship can take your skills to the next level.  
  
You get access to an Immersive Learning Environment, collaborative projects, industry exposure, mentorship, accountability partnerships, and Job opportunities.

## Conclusion

Learning Laravel is not easy but this guide helps to streamline the process and gives a bit of direction to your journey. My Idea is, If you learn each of Laravel's features independently, You could master the framework a lot faster.

Remember to start with the basics, ask questions a lot, and Don't stop learning. It takes practice, persistence, and commitment. you can become a Laravel expert.
