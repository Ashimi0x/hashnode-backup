## How to be a Hacker

## Who is a hacker?

A hacker is often considered as that bad guy that breaks into computers and steal people's private stuff, that isn't totally true. There are in fact, three types of hackers, and they are categorized based on "Hats". 

Black Hat Hackers, White Hat Hackers, and Grey Hat Hackers.

Black hat hackers are the bad guys who can be annoying as they mess around with people's computers and steal personal information or even take your money.

Grey hat hackers are often described as the Robin Hood hackers, they are neither good nor bad guys, they usually see their selves as people who provide justice through hacking e.g the anonymous collective of hackers(Those cool guys with the Guy Fawkes' mask).
